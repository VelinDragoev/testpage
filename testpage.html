  <h1>Best BJJ Rash Guard</h1>
  <p>A good BJJ rash guard should fit you like a glove, protect you from mat burn, and wick away sweat. And during that whole time, it should be breathable, so that you don’t feel like you’re training in a sauna!</p>
  <p>In order to make this list, I’ve poured through hundreds of user reviews and combined them with the knowledge gained from my 15 years of martial arts experience. So no matter how experienced (or inexperienced) you are, this review will definitely help you find what you’re looking for!</p>

      <p>Hayabusa is one of the best-known brands in combat sports. And their Marvel-themed rash guards are a great example of why that is.</p>
      <p>They’re made of 84% polyester and 16 elastane which gives them a great fit. They’re also surprisingly breathable, making sure you don’t get distracted during your training.</p>
      <p>The construction of the Marvel Hero Elitte Rash Guard is also very high quality. It has flatlock seams and reinforced stitches, making it very durable. This is especially important if your gym has tatamis with a rougher surface that can usually damage your rash guard.</p>
      <p>In terms of downsides, the main one here is the price. Like most of Hayabusa’s gear, this one is also on the high end. But in terms of quality, I think it’s definitely worth it. Also, I really like the designs – some of them are really flashy, while others are much more understated. So regardless of your particular taste, you’ll definitely find something you like.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b>b</p>
      <li>Very durable</li>
      <li>High breathability</li>
      <li>Good fit (especially if you're tall and thin)</li>
      <p><b>Cons:</b></p>
      <li>High price</li>
      <li>Runs a bit small</li>

  <h2>What To Look For in the Best BJJ Rash Guard?</h2>
  <h3>Long Sleeve Rash Guard vs Short Sleeve Rash Guard For BJJ</h3>
  <p>Some people prefer long sleeve rash guards, while others prefer to wear short sleeves on the mats.</p>
  <p>However, a lot of people prefer to wear short sleeves for NoGi because exposing your bare arms makes you more slippery. For NoGi, being slippery enough to quickly strip a grip is a big advantage.</p>
  <h3>Material</h3>
  <p>It’s important to consider material when purchasing a rash guard. The material of most rash guards is either a combination of spandex and nylon or polyester.</p>
  <p>Both materials are good for rash guards, so it’s up to you! I find that polyester and elastane are both the most comfortable and durable, but your experience may differ. Just experiment and see what works best for you!</p>
  <h3>Breathability</h3>
  <p>BJJ can get hot and sweaty, especially when you’re wearing a four-pound gi on top of a rash guard and spats. So, it’s important to have a breathable rash guard to wear under the gi.</p>
  <p>Even if you’re just wearing a rash guard to NoGi, it should still be airy and comfortable enough, so you don’t think too much about it while rolling.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the materials most commonly used in rash guards aren’t known for their breathability. The best rash guards are both thin enough to give you good breathability, but durable enough to withstand all the rolling and general wear and tear of a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu workout.</p>
  <h3>Flatlock Stitching</h3>
  <p>Flatlock stitching holds two pieces of fabric together without using a typical clothing seam.</p>
  <p>Flatlock stitching is useful for BJJ rash guards because it won’t cause skin irritation with excessive fabric overlap. A typical seam with a single thread can cause a rash or irritate your skin, which is what wearing a rash guard intends to prevent.</p>
  <p>Flatlock stitching also means that the seam will be less bulky. The less that you notice the clothing that you’re wearing while you roll, the more comfortable both you and your partner will be. So, flatlock stitching is ideal for both Gi and NoGi.</p>
  <h3>Fourway Stretch Fabric</h3>
  <p>Fourway stretch fabric has the perfect amount of stretch and recovery for BJJ. I know that when I fold myself in half doing a Berimbolo, I like my rash guard to stretch with me and return to perfect shape when I stand up to get my hand raised.</p>
  <p>Fourway stretch fabric is a very durable material for rash guards. It will return to its natural, form-fitting shape after all the wear and tear that a good Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu match puts it through.</p>
  <h3>Rubber or Silicone Waistband</h3>
  <p>Few things are more annoying than when a rash guard begins to ride up your waist while drilling or rolling.</p>
  <p>Some companies use rubber or silicone waistbands at the bottom of their rash guard so that it doesn’t ride up. This gives you one less thing to think about while you’re training.</p>
  <h3>Multipanel Construction</h3>
  <p>If you prioritize mobility, then it’s worth looking into a rash guard with multipanel construction.</p>
  <p>Since these rash guards use multiple pieces of fabric in their construction, they’re easier to move in than those that use a few pieces of a larger fabric.</p>
  <h3>Price</h3>
  <p>Yes, cost-efficient BJJ gear is always nice. Since most people who train often have to have multiple rash guards, spats, and gis to switch out between training sessions, it’s nice to keep the price low.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that a lot of the time, you get what you pay for. Some pricier rash guards are more durable, allowing you to train and compete in them for longer.</p>
  
  <h3>IBJJF Compliant</h3>
  <p>If you plan to compete at an IBJJF tournament, whether it’s an open or a major, be sure that your rash guard meets the organization’s requirements.</p>
  <p>There are a few rules regarding graphics and logos, but the main concern is that the rash guard displays your rank. Consult the IBJJF website for specific rules regarding dress.</p>
  <h3>Extra Features</h3>
  <p>Some rash guards have additional features that make them perfect for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. In particular, antimicrobial fabrics are especially useful on the mats.</p>
  <p>Fungal and bacterial infections are common amongst teammates and competitors alike. You should take precautions to avoid them, especially during an outbreak. Having a few rash guards with antimicrobial fabrics can be a smart move.</p>
  <p>Other features include breathable mesh fabric in the armpit area to avoid a permanent stench. Also, some companies offer cool limited edition designs that will guarantee that you’re the most stylish person on the mats.</p>
